        <p>
            I'm Nobody! who are you?
            <br>
            Are you-Nobody-Too?
            <br>
            Then there's a pair of us!
            <br>
            Don't tell! they'd banish us - you know!
            <br> 
        </p>
        <p>
            How dreary-to be-somebody!
            <br>
            How public- like a frog-
            <br>
            To tell one's name - the livelong June-
            <br>
            To an admiring Bog!
            <br>
